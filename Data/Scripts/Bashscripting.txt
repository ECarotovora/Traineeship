#use nano to make the name of your script
nano [name of my script]


#enter shebang line + script
#!usr/bin/env bash

for file in `ls |grep fastq` ; do fastx_trimmer -f l -l 95 -Q33 -i ${file} -o ${file}_trimmed; done

#Change file permission
chmod +755 [name of my script] ==> +rwxr-x-r-x  rwx for me but only r and executable for group and other
you can normally also use chmod +x [name of my script] ==> gives the same output but dont use this one because it is dangerous just given everybody permission

Execute by user is 100. Execute by group is 010. Execute by other is 001

Write by user is 200. Write by group is 020. Write by other is 002.

Read by user is 400. Read by group is 040. Read by other is 004.

Then you add these together to get the desired combination.

So to allow everyone to read it, but only Group to execute and User to write it (but for some reason not execute) would be:

400 + 040 + 004 and 010 and 200

That adds up to 600 + 050 + 004 = 654.

You could then run the command.

chmod +654 /path/to/file.extension to set it.
