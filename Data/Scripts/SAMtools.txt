First cleanup the files
Moved every .sam file to the SAM directory with 

for file in `ls |grep sam`; do mv ./SAM/; done

So had a few problems with the SAM tools import ==> It has changed to sam tools view
The alias can be used from now on

first make python script 
/nlustre/users/fourie/H.sapiens/gatk_resource_bundle/2.8/hg19/ucss.hg19.fasta is used as index list

After the script was checked 
i used for file in `ls |grep sam`; do ./SAM-to-BAM.py $file; done to make 166 Bash scripts

After that i used 
for file in `ls |grep sh`; do qsub $file; done


In the next step i need to SAM tools sort
first write the script in python

then i scheduled the making of the bash scripts with
for file in `ls| grep bam`; do ./SAM-sort.py $file; done

now I submitted the bash scripts to qsub
for file in `ls |grep sh`; do qsub $file; done

==> made a immense mistake ==> did not include option -o in the file ==> overwrited my bam files and 
created "sorted"bam files of 91 kb also no there was no output folder made available

So had to restart the process from sam view again
==> hence the second SAM folder just to have them available 
I'm going to copy the directory of bam files 




next step is sam SAM tools index 
First I moved all the scripts to my "Sorted" directory
next I created "Bams" directory for the .bam files
Last I created the Sam directory for the .sam files

The python script was created and then 
for file in `ls |grep sam`; do ./SAM-index.py $file; done to make 166 Bash scripts

After that i used 
for file in `ls |grep sh`; do qsub $file; done


Next step qualimap bamqc ==> to use this feature files have to be sorted
next step I replaced the .sh files to the scripts directory to have space
The python script is configured now.
I need to keep in mind that qualimap needs a different output directory
so in order to do that I had to create a new script.

I used for file in `ls|grep sorted`; do ./BAMQC.py $file;done to make 166 python scripts
next I use 
for file in `ls |grep sh`; do qsub $file; done
